##### Types of visualization tools

## Review
[Assignment 1](materials/Week 1/Assignment)

Notes:
- Going over critiques of visualizations from homework

------

### 3 Types:
- Explanatory (narrative)
- Exploratory
- Dashboards

------

## Explanatory/Narrative Tools

---

### What are they?
- Can range from single charts to large infographics
- Describe a specific aspect of the data, with the goal of communicating a predefined message
- Typically found in articles and reports
- Static (usually)

---

### When should they be used?
- When you have a piece of information or a message that you want to communicate to the user/reader/client
- To explain the results of an analysis or study
- In support of an argument
- When the user may not have deep prior knowledge of the data 

---

### Strengths
- Focused and direct
- More easily customizable
- Easier to design/build

Notes:
- Only needs to handle a single instance of data, and thus can be designed to fit the data rather than needing to adapt to any data that may be plugged into it

---

### Weaknesses
- Inflexible
- Context-dependent

------

## Exploratory Tools

---

### What are they?
- Built to present a large amount of data in a digestible manner
- Interactive--allow the user to slice and filter the data as they like
- "BI-style" applications

---

### When should they be used?
- When you want to allow the user (mostly) free access to all of the data
- When you don't have a specific message or piece of knowledge to communicate
- When the user is already familiar with the data and has the knowledge necessary to responsibly come to conclusions on their own

---

### Strengths
- Very flexible
- Can communicate many messages
- Fun

---

### Weaknesses
- Unfocused, harder to control
- Harder to design/build
- Can allow user to come to less-than-sound conclusions if they have bias or ignorance coming in

Notes:
- Mention 538 "now-cast" as pitfall when you let user decide

------

## Dashboards

---

### What are they?
- Concise, quickly digestible overviews presenting immediately actionable information
- Focuses on few key indicators
- Meant to be checked frequently (daily or more)
- Makes use of streaming (frequently changing) data

---

### When should they be used?
- For monitoring frequently-changing data
- When specific actions can and should be taken on a frequent basis 
- When timing and quick response is a priority

Notes:
- The term "dashboard" is overused
- Dashboards are meant to meet the specific need to informing real-time actions of its users
- If it is looked at less frequently or contains more information and detail, then it is really a report, or series of explanatory tools

---

### Strengths
- Actionable 

---

### Weaknesses
-
