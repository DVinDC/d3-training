Critiques of the Gapminder's "State Time Value" visualization:

Positives:
- A large amount of information presented, without displaying too much at once
- Interesting to watch changes over time and see significant acute events, such as the massive and apparently global drop in life expectancy around 1917 (World War 1?)
- Good selection of axis choices/filters and color coding options
- Option of log vs linear axis scales is helpful

Negatives:
- A lot of the features are not labeled or clearly explained. It took me a while to figure out that the vertical tick marks at the lower right of the chart changed the speed, or that I could fade the opacity of the non-selected countries. I had to search for some of the places to change the dimensions/filters. I realized too late that there is a "How to Use" video.
- An average indicator (or median or other reference) would have been useful.

In my proposed alternative, the main display remains largely unchanged, but the user would have the option to select only particular regions/groups of countries more quickly than going throught the list and manually choosing each. I would also more clearly label features/controls, or include hover-over help text. Individual bubbles/markers could countain the flag of the county they represent, with the border/stroke of each bubble changing color instead of the entire color to indicate country groups.
