Critiques of the "Iraq's bloody toll" visualization:

Positives:
- I appreciate the attempt to make the bars appear like blood by having them extend downward rather than upward
- Ambitiously tries to fit a great amount of information into one infographic

Negatives:
- So much information being displayed on one page means each individual piece is small and hard to read
- "Coalition deaths" doughnut chart is less than ideal, could easily be a stacked bar chart
- I'm not sure why the "Iraqi Security forces" deaths doughbut chart is halfway off the page, or what we're supposed to condlude from that. It would be better suited as a 
	part of the main "blood drip" display, as a third shade of red.
- "The biggest killers" chart of different sized circles is not an ideal way to display the differences between these categories/causes of death. Again, could easily be a bar chart.
- Regarding the map, I would have appreciated more than 3 bins for the count of fatalitities. Having provinces with 0 deaths shaded the same as those with 99, and similarly 106 being the same shade as 437 is not ideal, and could convey more information quickly with perhaps 5 or 6 shades of red (with white representing zero deaths), to match the rest of the infographic.

In my proposed alternative, the "Iraqi Security Forces" deaths are combined into the stacked bar chart with those of Civilians and Coalition Forces. I would suggest a similar, separate stacked bar chart to display the "Biggest Killers" information on causes of death, instead of the differently-sized circles used in the infographic. The map would be a separate visualization as well, using 7 color bins (0, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, 500+) rather than 3.
