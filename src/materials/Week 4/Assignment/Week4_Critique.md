Critiques of the "Democrats/Republicans" visualization:

Positives:
- Pretty good data-to-ink ratio. Not much superflous imagery, lines or colors.
- Not trying to present too much in one chart.

Negatives:
- Lack of a title means that the viewer has no idea what data the chart represents.
- The diverging bars in either direction make it difficult to immediately see which side is longer/larger.
- No idea what the categories actually mean from their one-word labels.

In my suggested alternative, I'm grouping the democrat/republican bars side-by-side so that they can be visually compared. This hopefully keeps things simpler/more intuitive to the viewer. Having no idea what the chart is trying to display, I can only suggest adding a title of some kind that explains what's being shown. More descriptive category names may also be in order, depending on the subject matter.
