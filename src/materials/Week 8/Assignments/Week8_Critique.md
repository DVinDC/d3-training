Critiques of the Gapminder's "Refugees" visualization:

Positives:
- Visually attactive
- Large amount of data presented

Negatives:
- Use of pie chart/circular angles is not ideal for the human eye
- Not very intuitive. Difficult to immediately understand what I'm looking at, with the lines ("cords") drawn between different countries.
- Not sure if there's a story it's telling, or if it's meant to be 100% exploratory.
- Introduction/tutorial progresses at an annoying pace, and doesn't allow the user to go back, so if I missed something, I need to watch the entire tutorial again at the same annoying pace.

This could probably be achieved with stacked bar charts, showing the same proportions of refugees in each country, with lines showing percentages coming from each source country.
