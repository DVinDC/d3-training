Critiques of the "Number of Orders and Amount of Sales (last year)" visualization:

Positives:
- Pretty good data-to-ink ratio. Not much superflous imagery, lines or colors.
- I think they were attempting to keep things simple.

Negatives:
- The dual y-axes are, at best, confusing.
- The fact that the "Amount of Sales" y-axis begins at 100k makes drops in Sales seem more perhaps more significant (as a percentage of the whole) than they really are.
- For February, the "Amount of Sales" line obscures the data label over the "Number of Orders". In this case, it's not hard to still identify that the February count is 450, but using this method this could cause problems.

In my suggested alternative, I'm using color as a dimension to show the number of orders, while using the height of the bars to illustrate the Amount of Sales. I think this may provide a more understandable alternative. I considered using stacked bars, but the number of orders in each month is very insignificant to the amount of sales, and thus took up little-to-no visible area at the bottom of each bar.
