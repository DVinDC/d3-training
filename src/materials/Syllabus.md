# Course Syllabus

### Overview and Goals 
This 10-week course is designed to teach you (the student) the fundamentals of data visualization and how to apply these concepts in a practical manner using D3. Most lessons and course activities will revolve around the following concepts:
- Fundamentals of web development
- Principles of data visualization design
- Constructing data visualizations in D3
- Data visualization at Mathematica

By the end of the course you should have enough mastery of these concepts to comfortably independently take on a data visualization task for a project at Mathematica, including requirements gathering, design, and programming.

### Expectations
#### Students
There are no specific prerequisites for the course beyond some general experience working with data. No experience with JavaScript or web development is required, but all of the programming in the course and it's assignments will be in JavaScript. We will not spend much time covering basic JavaScript programming, but resources (including the first assignment) will be provided to help you learn how to program in JavaScript.

You will be expected to devote a significant amount of time to this course outside of the allotted class time. There will be weekly assignments of varying length and difficulty, but most will require multiple hours of work.

In addition to attending classes and completing assignments, I also expect and encourage you to be proactive in your learning. Please ask questions and give me feedback early and often during classes and by email/phone/Jabber between classes.

#### Instructor
Beyond providing informative lectures and assignments, I will be responsible for providing prompt and detailed feedback on all assignments (as relevant). Additionally, I will make myself as accessible as possible for questions outside of class time. 

I will also hold a weekly open office hours session.

### Final Project
For your final project you will create a data visualization tool meeting the following minimum requirements:
1. At least three different types of charts/visualizations
2. At least two types of interaction (tooltips, filters, etc.)
3. At least one transition

Along with your tool, you will submit a brief written document including:
1. The goals of the tool (what are you trying to show? Who is your intended audience?)
2. Why you chose the type of tool you did (dashboard/exploration tool/narrative/infographic)
3. How each feature (chart, interaction, etc.) contributes to meeting the visualization goals

Your tool can use any data that you choose.





# NOTES

Add names (me, Charlie)
Pre-course surveys
Weekly surveys
Chrome (for class), FireFox
