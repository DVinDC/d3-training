# Homework 1

This homework will focus on inserting various svg elements in the DOM using D3. Unless otherwise stated, all tasks should be done using D3. To begin, clone this repo using git. 

### PART 1
1. You will use the climate.json file to create a horizontal bar chart that shows yearly global temperatures. 
2. Use console.log(nameOfYourData) to explore the array in your console.
3. You should use a scale for the x axis. 
4. The width of the bar should be related to the temperature and the each bar should have a label indicating which year that temperature represents.
5. The color of the bar should change each decade (you can choose whichever color you would like for each decade)
6. the height of each bar should be 5 pixels with 2 pixels seperating each bar. 
7. The chart should have a title, axes, and labels on the axes

### PART 2
1. You will use the air_quality.csv to create a vertical bar chart that shows emmissions by state. 
2. You should use a scale for the x and y axis
3. The height of the bar should represent emmissions and each bar should represent a state
4. You should color each bar by its region.
7. The chart should have a title, axes, and labels on the axes

Once completed submit a pull request to the repo with all of your code.
